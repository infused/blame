Automatically userstamps create and update operations if the table has columns
named *created_by* and/or *updated_by*.  The Blamer gem attempts to mirror the
simplicity of ActiveRecord's timestamp module.

Blamer expects `Thread.current[:current_user]` to return the current user.
Storing the `current_user` in `Thread.current` ensures that this gem is
threadsafe (e.g., compatible with threaded webservers like Puma).  Basic setup
involves assigning to `Thread.current[:current_user]` in a controller before
filter:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      before_filter :set_userstamp

      def set_userstamp
        Thread.current[:current_user] = User.find(session[:user_id])
      end
    end

If you don't want to use `Thread.current[:current_user]` you can override this
behavior by writing your own *userstamp_object* method in ActiveRecord::Base or
any of your models. For example, to use Person.current:

    def userstamp_object
      Person.current
    end

If you don't like created_by/updated_by you can customize the column names:

    # Globally in environment.rb
    ActiveRecord::Base.created_userstamp_column = :creator_id

    # In a model definition
    class Subscription
      self.created_userstamp_column = :creator_id
      self.updated_userstamp_column = :updater_id
    end

Automatic userstamping can be turned off globally by setting:

    ActiveRecord::Base.record_userstamps = false

Blamer adds a *userstamps* migration helper which will add the created_by and
updated_by columns (or your custom column names) to your table:

    create_table :widgets do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
      t.userstamps
    end
